    <h4>About Us</h4>

    <p>Waiters on Wheels Worcester was established in January 2012 as a small business in Worcester, Ma. Have you ever had one of those days where you just don’t want to leave the house, have nothing in the fridge, but couldn’t stand the thought of “regular take-out”? That’s where we come in. Waiters on Wheels will pick up your order from a fantastic restaurant in Worcester and deliver your gourmet meal to your door. We realize that sometimes “take-out” doesn’t offer the best dining options, so we’re re-defining those options and bringing quality food to your door. 

    <p>We strive for excellent service, speedy delivery, and professional demeanor. 

    <p>WOW Worcester was founded by Stacy Anders. Stacy grew up in Worcester and knows Worcester dining. Her favorite spot is EVO. She also loves movie nights, catered dinners, and white wine. <br><br>
