    <p><h2>Do I need a membership or a business account?</h2>
        No.

    <p><h2>How do I place an order?</h2>
        First check the restaurant you want to order from and Waiters on Wheels hours to see if both are open for business. Then, give us a call and an

        $4.95 flat rate for all delivery orders. 

    <p><h2>Should I tip?</h2>
        Absolutely. Our drivers go to the restuarant, put in your order, and bring you your food. The cost of the delivery is not a tip- this is a service charge to keep us running. If you are happy with the service, you should definitely tip your driver.
